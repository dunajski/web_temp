# Feel free to use it, describe unclear decisions.

I would like to send from embedded device some bytes over serial to PC.
Then, send those bytes to show them on the web.

As @matthew-hub mention in private conversation, we can use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
I think you should explain your decision here.

Did you mention that the only proper firebase python api is https://pypi.org/project/firebase/ ?

And then when you somehow get those bytes on serwer, just show them on web api, this is almost done I think it only will need some refresh.
